## Why is a good abstract important?

- People often judge from an abstract of a paper to decide whether or not they want to invest their time in it.
- Online databases typically contain only abstracts.
- Editors or reviewers use abstracts as the first parts to evaluate your work.

Hence, a concise and effective abstract well-describing your work increases search-ability and readership, and most important of all, expedite editorial evaluation.

## My steps for writing an abstract

1. Write the paper first, and then use the abstract as a self-contained summary.
2. As I start to work on the abstract, I go over the paper and outline the following: 

    **Elements I collect before for an abstract**
    - **Motivation of my work** (Optional)
        - Why do my readers need to care about the problem?
            - strengthen the importance of my work
        - If    1) the motivation could not be easily written
            
            or  2) the problem is widely recognized as important, I’ll give a brief introduction to the problem/research area instead, or just skip this part.
            
            - Ex: mention the difficulty of the research area
    - **Problem statement**
        - What is the problem I am trying to solve?
        - Clearly define the scope of my work, ex: a general approach, a framework for historical research
    - **Approach**
        - What is my method? How did I solve the problem?
    - **Results**
        - What’s the result of my approach?
            - This is usually the evaluation part of the designed model.
            - ex: better performance.
        - focus on key results and findings
    - **Conclusion**
        - What are the implications of the results/findings? Why does it matter? What’s the impact?
        - What is the message I want my readers to take home (remember about my work)?
        
3. Other considerations
    - Include keywords or phrases to help readers search for my paper
    - Don’t include citations or references, unless you know your audience will be experts in this research area. Keep it straightforward for a general audience
4. After finishing the first draft of the abstract. I check if all the key ideas of the paper are included.
