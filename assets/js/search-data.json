            "content": "Why is a good abstract important? . People often judge from an abstract of a paper to decide whether or not they want to invest their time in it. | Online databases typically contain only abstracts. | Editors or reviewers use abstracts as the first parts to evaluate your work. | . Hence, a concise and effective abstract well-describing your work increases search-ability and readership, and most important of all, expedite editorial evaluation. . My steps for writing an abstract . Write the paper first, and then use the abstract as a self-contained summary. | As I start to work on the abstract, I go over the paper and outline the following: . Elements I collect before for an abstract . Motivation of my work (Optional) Why do my readers need to care about the problem? strengthen the importance of my work | . | If 1) the motivation could not be easily written . or 2) the problem is widely recognized as important, I’ll give a brief introduction to the problem/research area instead, or just skip this part. . Ex: mention the difficulty of the research area | . | . | Problem statement What is the problem I am trying to solve? | Clearly define the scope of my work, ex: a general approach, a framework for historical research | . | Approach What is my method? How did I solve the problem? | . | Results What’s the result of my approach? This is usually the evaluation part of the designed model. | ex: better performance. | . | focus on key results and findings | . | Conclusion What are the implications of the results/findings? Why does it matter? What’s the impact? | What is the message I want my readers to take home (remember about my work)? | . | . | Other considerations Include keywords or phrases to help readers search for my paper | Don’t include citations or references, unless you know your audience will be experts in this research area. Keep it straightforward for a general audience | . | After finishing the first draft of the abstract. I check if all the key ideas of the paper are included. |",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
